# Weather Data Visualization

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a weather dataset and provides visualizations to better understand temperature, humidity, and other metrics over time.  
The goal is to explore the data, identify patterns, and present the results through various plots including histograms, line plots, scatter plots, boxplots, and pie charts.

---

## Dataset
- **File:** `Project 1 - Weather Dataset.csv`  
- **Description:** Contains weather observations including temperature, humidity, and dates.  
- **Columns:** `Date`, `Temperature`, `Humidity`, etc. (after cleaning).

---

## Visualizations
The project includes the following visualizations:

1. **Histogram of Temperature** – Shows distribution of temperature values.  
2. **Line Plot of Temperature over Time** – Shows how temperature changes over dates.  
3. **Scatter Plot: Temperature vs Humidity** – Explores relationship between temperature and humidity.  
4. **Boxplot of Temperature** – Detects outliers and visualizes spread of temperature.  
5. **Pie Chart of Temperature Ranges** – Shows percentage of observations in different temperature ranges.

## Files
- `Task3_Data_Visualization.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with all analysis and plots.  
- `Project 1 - Weather Dataset.csv` – Dataset used for analysis.  
- `screenshots-2/` – Folder containing screenshots of generated plots.

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pavani-yadav/CodeAlpha-Datavisualization.git
cd CodeAlpha-Datavisualization
````

2. Open the notebook `Task3_Data_Visualization.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run all cells to generate visualizations.

## Tools & Libraries

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

---

## Screenshots

Screenshots of plots are available in the `screenshots-2/` folder.

---

## Observations / Insights

* You can add any interesting patterns or findings you notice in the data here.
* For example, you might notice trends in temperature changes over time or correlations between temperature and humidity.

---

## Future Work

* Add more visualizations like humidity trends, wind speed analysis, or combined metrics.
* Interactive dashboards using Plotly or Dash for better user experience.
